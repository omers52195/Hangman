# Hangman
Hangman Game

This is a group project to create a console based hangman game that "randomly" chooses a word using 26 uppercase latin letters 
then allows a player to guess single letters until the word is fully revealed or a limit on wrong guressed letters is reached.

Version 2 may provide an improved interface using HTML & CSS.
